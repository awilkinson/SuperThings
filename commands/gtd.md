## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Email Formatting Rules

**Zapier Gmail requires HTML formatting.** Plain text newlines (`\n`) are IGNORED and will render as one giant paragraph.

### Always Include These Parameters
```javascript
{
  body_type: "html",  // REQUIRED for paragraph breaks
  body: "<p>First paragraph</p><p>Second paragraph</p>",
  // ... other fields
}
```

### HTML Formatting Reference

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Paragraph break | `</p><p>` or `<p>...</p>` |
| Line break within paragraph | `<br>` |
| Bullet list | `<ul><li>Item</li></ul>` |
| Bold | `<strong>text</strong>` |
| Link | `<a href="url">text</a>` |
| Signature line break | `Name<br>Title` |

### Signature Formats

**External emails** (cold outreach, follow-ups, meeting requests):
```html
<p>-Andrew<br>
___<br>
<a href="https://www.tiny.com">www.tiny.com</a></p>
```

**Internal/colleague emails** (delegate, ask questions):
```html
<p>Thanks,<br>
Andrew</p>
```

**Intro emails** (casual, connecting two people):
```html
<p>-Andrew</p>
```

### Common Mistakes to AVOID

1. **Plain newlines** - `\n` does nothing, use `<br>` or `<p>`
2. **Missing body_type** - Defaults to plain text, breaks all formatting
3. **Wall of text** - Always break into 3-5 short paragraphs max
4. **Over-formatting** - Keep HTML minimal, no inline styles

---

## Research Cache System

**All research results are cached** to `~/Projects/SuperThings/data/research-cache.json`:
- Results persist for 7 days
- Use `/gtd resume` to continue a previous session
- Say "details N" to expand cached findings

## Workflow

### Step 1: Check for Previous Session
```bash
cat ~/Projects/SuperThings/data/research-cache.json
```
If recent session exists (< 24h), ask: "Continue previous session or start fresh?"

### Step 2: Fetch Tasks
- Computer: `mcp__things-mcp__things_get_project` with `LDhUsibk3dp2ZPioQySSiu`
- Deep Work: `mcp__things-mcp__things_get_project` with `WamuBi2sFwbUwpXz9NZetP`

### Step 3: Categorize Tasks

| # | Category | Pattern | Tool | Action |
|---|----------|---------|------|--------|
| 1 | **URL tasks** | Contains http://, https://, youtu.be | Firecrawl | Scrape page, summarize content |
| 2 | **Research/DD** | "Research X", "DD on X", "Look into X" | Tavily | Deep multi-source search |

| 25 | **Not helpable** | Physical tasks, calls, in-person meetings | Skip | Mark for manual handling |

### Step 4: Execute Research (Batched)

**Rate limit protection**: Max 8 parallel agents per batch.

For each task type:

**URL Tasks** (Firecrawl):
1. Scrape URL with `mcp__firecrawl-mcp__firecrawl_scrape`
2. Extract title, description, key content
3. Summarize with TLDR bullets
4. Cache results immediately

**Research Tasks** (Tavily):
1. Search with `mcp__tavily__tavily_search`
2. Synthesize findings from multiple sources
3. Include specific facts, numbers, names
4. Cache results immediately

**Browser Tasks** (BrowserBase):
1. Launch browser session with `mcp__browserbase__*`
2. Navigate to target URL
3. Handle login if needed (use saved credentials or ask user)
4. Perform action (screenshot, extract data, fill form)
5. Cache results with screenshots if relevant

**Email/Intro Tasks** (Zapier):
1. Search inbox for prior context: `mcp__zapier__gmail_find_email`
2. Draft email based on task + context
3. Present draft for approval
4. On approval: `mcp__zapier__gmail_send_email`

### Step 5: Display Results (Rich TLDR Format)

**Time estimates** (show before research):
```
Research tasks found: [N]

Estimated time breakdown:
├─ URL tasks (5): ~10 min (fast scrapes)
├─ Research tasks (3): ~25 min total
│   ├─ "Research competitor pricing" (~15 min)
│   ├─ "Find best practices for X" (~10 min)
├─ Email tasks (2): ~5 min
└─ Total: ~40 min

Proceed with research? [Y/n]
```

**Time estimation rules:**
- URL tasks: ~2 min each (fast Firecrawl scrape)
- Research tasks: ~5-20 min each depending on complexity
  - Simple lookup: ~5 min ("What is X", "Find X contact")
  - Analysis: ~10 min ("Compare X vs Y", "Find best X")
  - Deep research: ~15-20 min ("Comprehensive analysis of X")
- Email tasks: ~2-3 min each (draft generation)
- Browser tasks: ~5-10 min each (navigation, interaction)

**After research:**
```
Research Complete: [N] tasks processed

┌─ 1 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│  [Task Title]
│
│  • Key finding 1 with specific details
│  • Key finding 2 with numbers/facts
│  • Key finding 3 with actionable insight
│  • Additional bullet if needed
│  • Source: [where info came from]
│
├─ 2 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│  https://example.com/article (URL task)
│
│  • Article title: "How to Build X"
│  • Main thesis: [summary of what the link contains]
│  • Key points from the actual page content
│  • Why this was saved (inferred from context)
│  • Source: Firecrawl (visited link)
│
├─ 3 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
│  Research competitor pricing
│
│  • Found 5 competitors: Acme ($15/mo), Beta ($25/mo)...
│  • Enterprise tiers range $100-500/seat
│  • Key differentiator: only Gamma has API at base tier
│  • Annual discounts: 15-25% typical
│  • Sources: Tavily (G2, Capterra, pricing pages)
```

**Display rules:**
- Use as many bullets as needed to capture key findings
- Keep each bullet concise but informative (TLDR style)
- For URL tasks: summarize actual content from the page
- Always include sources and which tool was used

## Triage Commands

After research display, user responds with commands:

| Command | Action | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `C` | Complete task in Things | `1: C` |
| `C [note]` | Complete with note | `1: C already handled last week` |
| `D [person]` | Delegate - draft email via Zapier | `2: D Brianna` |
| `D [person] [modifier]` | Delegate with context | `2: D Brianna within the next week` |
| `DD` | Deep Dive - use **Tavily** for expanded research | `3: DD` |
| `DD [focus]` | Deep Dive with specific focus | `3: DD focus on enterprise pricing` |

**Example triage response:**
```
1: C
2: D Brianna please handle by Friday
3: DD focus on North American competitors only
4-6: C
7: D John can you review this contract
8: C noted for future reference
```

**Default behavior**: Tasks without commands are kept in Things with notes updated.

## Command Execution

### C (Complete)
Mark task complete in Things using `mcp__things-mcp__things_update_todo`.

### D (Delegate)
1. Parse: `D [person] [optional modifier]`
2. Search inbox for person's email: `mcp__zapier__gmail_find_email`
3. Draft email via Zapier:
   ```
   To: [person's email]
   Subject: Task: [task title]

   Hi [Person],

   Could you help with this? [task description]

   [Include research findings if relevant]

   [modifier context if provided, e.g., "Ideally by Friday"]

   Thanks,
   Andrew
   ```
4. Show draft for approval
5. On approval: Send via `mcp__zapier__gmail_send_email`
6. Mark Things task complete

### DD (Deep Dive)
1. Parse: `DD [optional focus]`
2. Launch **Tavily** deep research with expanded queries
3. Use multiple search queries to get comprehensive coverage
4. If focus provided, concentrate searches on that aspect
5. Update cache with expanded findings
6. Display new results with Tavily sources

## URL/Link Handling

**Critical**: If a task contains a URL, use **Firecrawl** to scrape:

1. Scrape with `mcp__firecrawl-mcp__firecrawl_scrape`
2. Extract and summarize the actual page content
3. Include:
   - What the page/video/article is about
   - Key points and takeaways
   - Why the user likely saved this
4. Mark source as "Firecrawl (visited link)"

Example URL task handling:
```
Task: "https://youtu.be/abc123"

Using Firecrawl to scrape YouTube page:
1. Get video title, description, duration
2. If transcript available, summarize key points
3. Infer why saved (topic, speaker, relevance)

Output:
• Video: "The Future of AI" by Sam Altman (45 min)
• Key points: GPT-5 roadmap, multimodal focus, AGI timeline
• Discusses compute scaling concerns
• Likely saved for: AI strategy research
• Source: Firecrawl (visited link)
```

## Cache Management

### Cache Structure
```json
{
  "last_updated": "ISO-timestamp",
  "sessions": {
    "session-uuid": {
      "started_at": "ISO-timestamp",
      "tasks_researched": 32,
      "results": [
        {
          "task_id": "Things-UUID",
          "task_title": "Research X",
          "researched_at": "ISO-timestamp",
          "tool_used": "tavily|firecrawl|zapier",
          "findings": "Full research text with all bullets...",
          "sources": ["url1", "url2"],
          "user_decision": "complete|delegate|deepdive|pending",
          "notes_updated": true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cache Operations
- **Write**: After each research batch completes
- **Read**: On `/gtd resume` or "details N" request
- **Cleanup**: Remove sessions older than 7 days

## Resume Previous Session

If user says `/gtd resume`:
1. Read cache file
2. Find most recent session
3. Display previous results (from cache, not re-researched)
4. Allow user to continue triage where they left off

## Parallel Execution Rules

**Rate limit protection:**
- Max 8 parallel agents per batch
- Wait for batch completion before launching next
- Retry rate-limited tasks in next batch
- Use haiku model for research agents (faster, cheaper)

```
Batch 1: [task 1-8] → wait → check failures
Batch 2: [task 9-16 + retries] → wait → check
Batch 3: [remaining + retries] → etc.
```

## Project IDs
- Computer: `LDhUsibk3dp2ZPioQySSiu`
- Deep Work: `WamuBi2sFwbUwpXz9NZetP`

## Execution

Now execute the GTD workflow:
1. Check for previous session in cache
2. Fetch tasks from both projects
3. Categorize tasks by type (URL → Firecrawl, Research → Tavily, Email → Zapier)
4. Execute research with appropriate tools
5. Cache results immediately
6. Display rich TLDR summaries with tool sources
7. Process C/D/DD commands
8. Update cache with decisions
